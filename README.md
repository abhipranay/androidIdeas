##Repository to implement ideas for android projects

This repository is built with a aim to implement two android application ideas

**1. Offers4You**
**2. GetFound**


####Offers4You


######Basic Idea:

To implement server and client to notify people visiting a mall about the latest value offers for them.
These can be for individuals and also for a group.

Please someone extend it :)

####GetFound


######Basic Idea:

The child feature of the above app ( can also be implemented as separate app).
This app will make use of GPS and will try to locate you and your added group in a small area like Mall.
(Obviously group members will be running this app.)


Will extend all the features later after some study.
